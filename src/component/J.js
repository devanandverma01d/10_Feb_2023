Catch live score and updates of the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy here.India vs Australia, 1st Test, Day 2 Live Updates: Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja have helped India recover from losing two wickets early in the second session. The pair saw India through to the lead and the partnership between them was on 61 off 130 when Cummins sent Rohit back. Rohit's epic knock thus ended on 120 off 212 balls. India have since lost debutant KS Bharat, falling to Todd Murphy who has incredibly got his maiden first class five-wicket haul in his first ever Test match. Australia have managed to claw back into the match once again after Jadeja ajd Rohit wiped out the advantage they had gaine after taking two wickets early in the second session. Virat Kohli became Murphy's fourth wicket of this innings off the very first ball of the second session. Suryakumar Yadav then fell to Nathan Lyon, the first wicket that the ace Australian spinner has taken in this match. Rohit, however, seem to be unperturbed by the dismissals and grinded out his 9th Test century. Ravichandran Ashwin and Rohit earlier ensured that India maintain their Day 1 scoring rate. Their partnership was on 42 off 104 when the former fell to Murphy. India had started the day on 77/1 and went past 100 within the first 10 overs of the day itself. Ashwin scored 23 off 62 balls after which a rather aggressive Cheteshwar Pujara was dismissed by Murphy as well. At the end of the first session of Day 2, Rohit was on 85 off 142 while Kohli has scored 12 off 25. On Thursday, Jadeja, playing his first international match since August last year, claimed five wickets as Australia were all out for 177 halfway through the third session. Jadeja ended with figures of 5/37 while Ashwin returned 3/42. Ashwin also became the second Indian bowler after Anil Kumble to go past 450 Test wickets in the process.
